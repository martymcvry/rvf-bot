update 2010-11-13
-----------------

Some people were complaining that the FTP doesn't work.
This meant: time for an overhaul.

Installation instructions for this update:
1° If the bot is running, close it.
2° Copy the file top10-score.mrc to the folder "mirc-fun".
3° Copy the files cmd.ftp and newftp.bat to the folder "mirc-fun/export".
4. Reboot the bot.
5. It's possible, during the first export, that you will get a message from
   Windows-firewall. You, of course, need to allow the transfer to continue.
